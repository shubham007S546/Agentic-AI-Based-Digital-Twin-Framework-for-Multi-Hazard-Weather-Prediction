## 3. Area Sample Extraction Process  

Upon successful submission of an area sample request, AppEEARS initiates a processing pipeline that utilizes various services and utilities to identify and process source granules matching the query parameters. This pipeline can reproject the area(s) of interest and source files to the selected projection and will clip data to the defined area(s). Note that AppEEARS will filter out outputs containing only fill values, ensuring no empty output files are generated.

For each spatial feature, a series of tools and services are used to determine which source granules intersect with the coordinates of the feature for the data layer of interest. The source granule is opened and data within the feature's bounding extent are extracted. If the source grids align and it is appropriate, the extracted data are mosaicked together using a reverse painting method. This process is implemented for all granules within the requested temporal period. If the user chooses a non-native output projection, then the data are reprojected into the user-requested projection using the PROJ.4 definition. The data are finally clipped to the input feature shape to only maintain the data intersecting the feature shape. Data outside of the feature shape are converted to a product-specific NODATA value. Each clipped image is saved as a cloud-optimized Geospatial Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF) file with a unique name, or as a CF-compliant NetCDF following the naming conventions described in Section 4 of this README. During NetCDF construction, images are stacked along the time dimension to provide a single time series stack for each product and feature requested, where alignment permits.

AppEEARS implements a strict procedure for reprojecting data outputs. Pixel size and resampling methods are non-customizable in AppEEARS. Reprojected data are produced using the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) gdalwarp function in combination with the PROJ.4 string definition for the user-defined output projection type. Reprojection is performed using nearest neighbor resampling. If the projection units are the same between the native and output projections, the native pixel size is used to reproject the image. If the projection units between the native and output projections are different (e.g. sinusoidal (m) to geographic (degrees), pixel size is calculated by reprojecting the center pixel of the original image, calculating its width and height, and using those dimensions to define a square output pixel size). The latitude and longitude of the region of interest are maintained in the conversion.

**NOTE:**  

- Requested date ranges may not match the reference date for multi-day products. AppEEARS takes an inclusive approach when extracting data for sample requests, often returning data that extends beyond the requested date range. This approach ensures that the returned data includes records for the entire requested date range.  
- If selected, the SRTM v3, ASTER GDEM v3 and Global Water Bodies Database v1, and NASADEM v1 products will be extracted regardless of the time period specified in AppEEARS because they are static datasets. The date field in the data tables reflect the nominal date for each of these products.  
- If the visualizations indicate that there are no data to display, proceed to checking the .csv output file. Data products that have both categorical and continuous data values (e.g. MOD15A2H) are not able to be displayed in the visualizations within AppEEARS.  

The PROJ.4 definitions for each data collection available through AppEEARS are listed below.

## 5. Data Quality  

When available, AppEEARS extracts and returns quality assurance (QA) data for each data file returned regardless of whether the user requests it. This is done to ensure that the user possesses the information needed to determine the usability and usefulness of the data they get from AppEEARS. Most data products available through AppEEARS have an associated QA data layer. Some products have more than one QA data layer to consult. See below for more information regarding data collections/products and their associated QA data layers.  

### 5.1. MODIS (Terra, Aqua, & Combined)  

All MODIS land products, as well as the MODIS Snow Cover Daily product, include quality assurance (QA) information designed to help users understand and make best use of the data that comprise each product.  

- See the MODIS Land Products QA Tutorials: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/resources/e-learning/> for more QA information regarding each MODIS land product suite.
- See the MODIS Snow Cover Daily product user guide for information regarding QA utilization and interpretation.

**NOTE:**  

- The Version 6.1 Aqua and Terra MODIS Net Evapotranspiration data products (MOD16s and MYD16s), Gross Primary Productivity data products (MOD17s and MYD17s), in addition to Terra MODIS Leaf Area Index/FPAR (MOD15A2H) include data layers with multiple fill values describing the category of non-vegetated pixels.

### 5.2. NASA MEaSUREs Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Version 3 (v3)  

SRTM v3 products are accompanied by an ancillary "NUM" file in place of the QA/QC files. The "NUM" files indicate the source of each SRTM pixel, as well as the number of input data scenes used to generate the SRTM v3 data for that pixel.  

- See the user guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/179/SRTM_User_Guide_V3.pdf> for additional information regarding the SRTM "NUM" file.

### 5.3. NASA VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) & NOAA-20)  

All NASA VIIRS land products include quality information designed to help users understand and make best use of the data that comprise each product. For product-specific information, see the link to the NASA VIIRS products table provided in section 6.  

**NOTE:**  

- The version 2 Suomi NPP NASA VIIRS Surface Reflectance data products VNP09A1 and VNP09H1 contain two quality layers: `SurfReflect_State` and `SurfReflect_QC`. Both quality layers are provided to the user with the request results. 

- The Version 2 Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 Actual and Potential Evapotranspiration data products (VNP16s and VJ116s) in addition to Suomi NPP Leaf Area Index/FPAR (VNP15A2H) include data layers with multiple fill values describing the category of non-vegetated pixels; however, the data attributes in the source header file specify only one fill value. AppEEARS area requests return unscaled data consistent with the source products, so users should mask the additional fill values prior to scaling.  

### 5.4. SMAP  

SMAP products provide multiple means to assess quality. Each data product contains bit flags, uncertainty measures, and file-level metadata that provide quality information. Results downloaded from AppEEARS and/or data directly requested via middleware services contain not only the requested pixel/data values, but also the decoded bit flag information associated with each pixel/data value extracted. For additional information regarding the specific bit flags, uncertainty measures, and file-level metadata contained in this product, refer to the Quality Assessment section of the user guide for the specific SMAP data product in your request: <https://nsidc.org/data/smap/smap-data.html>.  

### 5.5. Daymet v4R1

Daymet station-level daily weather observation data and the corresponding Daymet model predicted data for three Daymet model parameters: minimum temperature (tmin), maximum temperature (tmax), and daily total precipitation (prcp) are available. These data provide information into the regional accuracy of the Daymet model for the three station-level input parameters. Corresponding comma separated value (.csv) files that contain metadata for every surface weather station for the variable-year combinations are also available. <https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/2129>

### 5.6. ECOSTRESS

#### 5.6.1. ECOSTRESS Swath V2

V2: Quality information varies by product for the ECOSTRESS product suite. Quality Assurance (QA) information for ECO_L2_LSTE.002, including the bit definition index for the quality layer, is provided in section 2.4 of the User Guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1574/ECOL2_User_Guide_V2.pdf>. For Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LSTE) product, the quality flags of the source data are available in the ECO_L2_LSTE.002 data product. Please note that unlike V1, the V2 LSTE product does not incorporate cloud cover into the Pixel Produced QA bit flag. This flag now relates to other variables only (See Table 6 in User Guide). Users should apply the cloud mask separately to account for pixels with cloud when using ECO_L2_LSTE.002 data product. Cloud mask derived from ECO_L2_CLOUD.002 and Water mask derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model are available as separate science dataset (SDS) layers in the ECO_L2_LSTE.002 data product. Additionally, cloud and cloud confidence layers are available in the ECO_L2_CLOUD.002 product. Results downloaded from AppEEARS contain requested pixel/data values, decoded Quality Assurance (QA), and cloud information associated with each pixel/data value extracted.

#### 5.6.2. ECOSTRESS Tiled V2  

Quality information varies by product for the ECOSTRESS product suite. Quality information for ECO_L2T_LSTE.002, including the bit definition index for the quality layer, is provided in section 2.4 of the User Guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1574/ECOL2_User_Guide_V2.pdf>. Results downloaded from AppEEARS contain requested pixel/data values and decoded QA information associated with each pixel/data value extracted. For Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LSTE) product, the quality flags of the source data are available as a separate SDS layer in the ECO_L2T_LSTE.002 collection, however this Pixel Produced QA bit flags do not account for cloud cover. Users should apply the cloud mask separately to account for pixels with cloud when using ECO_L2T_LSTE.002 collection. In addition to decoded quality information, AppEEARS returns the cloud mask information for requests including layers from ECO_L2T_LSTE.002. For high-level products, Cloud mask derived from ECO_L2_CLOUD.002 and Water mask derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model are available as separate science dataset (SDS) layers in the ECO_L2T_LSTE.002 data product.

The ECOSTRESS Tiled Evapotranspiration disALEXI 24-Hour L3 CONUS 70 m V002 (ECO_L3T_ET_ALEXI) and ECOSTRESS Tiled Evaporative Stress Index disALEXI 24-Hour L4 CONUS 70 m V002 (ECO_L4T_ESI_ALEXI) products provide Evapotranspiration Daily Uncertainty and Evaporative Stress Index Daily Uncertainty bands.

### 5.7. ASTER GDEM v3 and Global Water Bodies Database v1  

ASTER GDEM v3 data are accompanied by an ancillary "NUM" file in place of the QA/QC files. The "NUM" files refer to the count of ASTER Level-1A scenes that were processed for each pixel or the source of reference data used to replace anomalies. The ASTER Global Water Bodies Database v1 products do not contain QA/QC files.  

- See Section 7 of the ASTER GDEM user guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/434/ASTGTM_User_Guide_V3.pdf> for additional information regarding the GDEM "NUM" file.  
- See Section 7 of the ASTER Global Water Bodies Database user guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/436/ASTWBD_User_Guide_V1.pdf> for a comparison with the SRTM Water Body Dataset.

### 5.8. NASA MEaSUREs NASADEM v1 (30m)  

NASADEM v1 products are accompanied by an ancillary "NUM" file in place of the QA/QC files. The "NUM" files indicate the source of each NASADEM pixel, as well as the number of input data scenes used to generate the NASADEM v1 data for that pixel.  

- See the NASADEM user guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/592/NASADEM_User_Guide_V1.pdf> for additional information regarding the NASADEM "NUM" file.  

### 5.9. HLS v2.0  

HLS v2.0 Operational Land Imager (OLI) Surface Reflectance and TOA Brightness Daily Global 30m (HLSL30 v002) and Sentinel-2 Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI) Surface Reflectance Daily Global 30m (HLSS30 v002) products have a quality assessment layer enabling per-pixel masking of cloud, cloud shadow, snow, water, and aerosol optical thickness levels.

## 6. Data Caveats  

### 6.1. ECOSTRESS V2

#### 6.1.1. ECOSTRESS Swath V2  

- ECOSTRESS Swath data products are natively stored in swath format. To fulfill AppEEARS requests for ECOSTRESS Swath products, the data are first resampled from the native swath format to a georeferenced output. This requires the use of the requested ECOSTRESS product files and the corresponding ECO1BGEO: <https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO1BGEO.001> files for all ECOSTRESS Swath products. To do this conversion, an index array and distance array are created, then the nearest area pixel is located. Next, the Euclidean distance to that area pixel plus all surrounding pixels is measured within a 210 meter search radius (+/- a 3 pixels). This results in 49 pixels measured for every swath pixel. If the distance measured is less than what's currently present in any distance array, then the new distance as well as the swath index value are recorded into the index array used to convert to an area output.  

#### 6.1.2. ECOSTRESS Tiled V2  

- ECOSTRESS Tiled data products are stored as cloud optimized geotiffs tiled based on the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) to standardize data for ease of use in time-series analyses. The tiles are delivered in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. More detail can be found in the User Guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/423/ECO2_User_Guide_V2.pdf>.  
- Multiple ECOSTRESS v2 Tiled granules can exist per day for the same tile as a result of the ISS orbit. Since variables like surface temperature are highly time-dependent, tiles are only merged if they fall within the same UTM zone and have the same timestamp (both tiles are from the same orbit and scene). Merging is done using the `merge` function from the `rasterio` Python package. Please note, there is overlap in ECOSTRESS Source Tiled data and pixels do not align. Therefore, relatively slight pixel shift is expected in AppEEARS outputs.  
- It is not uncommon for many pixels returned to contain NaN values. If any layer requested or the QC layer contains valid data, the remaining requested layers will be returned even if only NaN values are present.  

### 6.2. NASA VIIRS SNPP, NOAA-20, and NOAA-21

- Several products from these instruments have multiple fill values that describe categorical information (i.e. water/ocean) about why the pixel was not processed in the source data. Many geospatial software applications apply automatic scaling when opening files, but there is no standard convention for multiple fill values. You can apply the scale factor and add offset to the valid range bounds and mask to remove these invalid data. Products where this is the case include:
    - VNP13, VJ113, and VJ213 Vegetation Indices Products
    - VNP15, VJ115, and VJ215 Leaf Area Index/FPAR Products
    - VNP16, VJ116, and VJ216 Evapotranspiration Products
    - VNP17, VJ117, and VJ217 Gross Primary Productivity and Photosynthesis Products
    - VNP22, VJ122, and VJ222 Land Surface Phenology Products

#### 6.2.1. Suomi NPP VIIRS Land Surface Phenology Product (VNP22Q2)  

- A subset of the science datasets/variables for VNP22Q2 are returned in their raw, unscaled form. That is, these variables are returned without having their scale factor and offset applied. AppEEARS visualizations and output summary files are derived using the raw data value, and consequently do not characterize the intended information ("day of year") for the impacted variables. The variables returned in this state include:  

    1. Date_Mid_Greenup_Phase (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)

- To convert the raw data to "day of year" (doy) for the above variables, use the following equation:  

      doy = Raw_Data_Value * 1 – (Given_Year - 2000) * 366

### 6.3. SMAP

#### 6.3.1. SMAP Enhanced L3 Radiometer Global and Polar Grid Daily 9 km EASE-Grid Soil Moisture (SPL3SMP_E)

- The SPL3SMP_E includes additional layers for AM and PM north-polar grid soil moisture retrievals. These additional layers are not supported in AppEEARS.

#### 6.3.2. SMAP L4 Global 3-hourly 9 km EASE-Grid Surface and Root Zone Soil Moisture Geophysical Data (SPL4SMGP)

- The SPL4SMGP provides 3-hourly data within a single day. AppEEARS COG output files specify the observation date as day of the year (`YYYYDOY`) in the filename followed by time information (`HHMMSS`). 
     - Example: `SPL4SMGP.008_Geophysical_Data_sm_surface_doy2025134013000_aid0001.tif`

- For NetCDF output files, AppEEARS specifies the observation date then time stamps in the file.

### 6.4. HLS v2.0  

- HLS has adopted a gridded tiling system based on the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) to standardize data for ease of use in time-series analyses. The tiles are delivered in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. More detail can be found in the User Guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1326/HLS_User_Guide_V2.pdf>.
- Scenes are merged using the `merge` function from the `rasterio` Python package if they fall within the same UTM zone.  
- When requesting HLS timeseries, note that Sentinel-2 launched after Landsat was already active. Landsat OLI (HLSL30 v002) products are available from 2013-04-11 to present, while Sentinel-2 MSI products (HLSS30 v002) are available from  2015-11-30 to present.  
- Extra granules from outside the region of interest specified may appear in the granule list if the region of interest is close to an area where MGRS tiles overlap.
- Historical processing of the HLS Vegetation Indices (VI) products (HLSS30_VI v002 and HLSL30_VI v002) has not started as of May 9, 2025. Data currently available in AppEEARS is from February 6, 2025 to present.

### 6.5. MOD44B V6.1

- Value zero in the Cloud and Quality layers from MOD44B Version 6.1 Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) yearly product is assigned to Fill Value in the source file while value zero is meaningful for those layers. If comparing Cloud and Quality layers outputs with source files, users may notice that within the source files zero is assigned to fill value, however zero is within the valid range. Thus, AppEEARS outputs use -999 as a fill value for those layers.

### 6.6. EMIT L1B Radiance and L2A Reflectance

- The EMIT mission is focused on collecting data from land arid dust source regions, meaning that coverage is limited to those regions based upon a mask. You can explore coverage and forecasted coverage using Jet Propulsion Laboratory's [Visions: EMIT Open Data Portal](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/data/data-portal/coverage-and-forecasts/)
- Both EMIT L1B Radiance and L2A Reflectance collections are natively provided in spatially raw, non-orthorectified format, but have an included geometry lookup table (GLT). The GLT is two-layered orthorectified (EPSG:4326) grid in the 'location' group of the NetCDF4 file that contains cross-track and down-track pixel indices that can be used to quickly and consistently orthorectify the radiance or reflectance products.
- EMIT area outputs are not mosaicked, each scene is subset to the specified region(s) and users can make the decision whether mosaicking adjacent scenes is appropriate.
- There are several output choices for EMIT area outputs. They can be requested as either netCDF4 format, or ENVI binary format with a header. Additionally, users may request area samples that are orthorectified or spatially raw (non-orthorectified) with a GLT.
- Elevation data is always included in requests. For API users there is an additional 'elev' layer listed, but that layer cannot be requested. This has to be present due to some constraints of AppEEARS' backend.

### 6.7. EMIT L2B Estimated Mineral Identification, Band Depth and Uncertainty

- The EMIT_L2B_MIN product is generated to support the EMIT mission objectives of constraining the sign of dust-related radiative forcing. Ten mineral types are the core focus of this work: Calcite, Chlorite, Dolomite, Goethite, Gypsum, Hematite, Illite+Muscovite, Kaolinite, Montmorillonite, and Vermiculite. Additional minerals are included in this product for transparency but were not the focus of this product. Further validation is required to use these additional mineral maps, particularly in the case of resource exploration. Similarly, the separation of minerals with similar spectral features, such as a fine-grained goethite and hematite, is an active research area. The results presented here are an initial offering, but the precise categorization is likely to evolve, and the limits of what can and cannot be separated on a global scale are still being explored. The user is encouraged to read the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document ([ATBD](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1659/EMITL2B_ATBD_v1.pdf)) for more details.  
- The EMIT L2B Mineral Identification, Band Depth and Uncertainty collection is natively provided in spatially raw, non-orthorectified format, but have an included geometry lookup table (GLT). The GLT is two-layered orthorectified (EPSG:4326) grid in the 'location' group of the NetCDF4 file that contains cross-track and down-track pixel indices that can be used to quickly and consistently orthorectify the data variables.  
- EMIT area outputs are not mosaicked, each scene is subset to the specified region(s) and users can decide whether mosaicking adjacent scenes is appropriate.  
- There are several output choices for EMIT area outputs. They can be requested as either netCDF4 format or ENVI binary format with a header. Additionally, users may request area samples that are orthorectified or spatially raw (non-orthorectified) with a GLT.

### 6.8. PACE OCI  Level-3 Global Mapped Data

- PACE OCI  Level-3 Global Mapped Data provide global coverage at three spatial resolutions — 0.1 degree, 2 km, and 4 km — and two temporal compositing intervals: daily and 8-day. To streamline data access and eliminate the need to filter by resolution or temporal period within a single collection, each collection has been integrated into AppEEARS as six separate products, one per resolution and temporal combination. Users are advised to select the collection that corresponds to their required spatial resolution and temporal compositing interval prior to submitting a request.

Collection names follow the convention PACE_OCI_L3M_SFREFL_[RESOLUTION]_[TEMPORAL], where resolution is denoted as 0p1deg, 2KM, or 4KM, and temporal interval as DAY or 8D.
